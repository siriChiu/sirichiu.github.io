### 💼 Key Projects & Contributions

#### Industrial/AI Server Fan Control Tool Development

1.  **Fan curve algorithm optimization, data collection, and deployment**
    *   `#Golang`, `#BashScript`, `#Algorithm`, `#Fancurve`, `#PIDalgorithm`, `#ipmitool`, `#BMC`
    *   **Innovative R&D**: Developed a methodology to analyze server endurance limits through pre-testing, automatically generating optimized temperature control algorithms.
    *   **Quantitative Results**: Testing verified that the new algorithm **improved performance by approximately 20%~40%** compared to traditional open-loop control strategies, effectively optimizing cooling efficiency and energy saving (Patent Pending).

2.  **Automated server stress testing tool development**
    *   `#Golang`, `#BashScript`, `#Algorithm`
    *   **Smart Burn-in Prediction**: Established a **Mathematical Regression Model** for burn-in testing. Used various stress scripts (CPU, GPU, RAM, FIO, ETH) as input variables to accurately predict and combine them to achieve target loads (e.g., precisely controlling at 50% or 100% loading).
    *   **Solving Pain Points**: Resolved the difficulty of precise load control in traditional testing, providing a high-reliability environment for airflow evaluation.

3.  **Real-time sensor data visualization and storage**
    *   `#Python`, `#Golang`, `#MySQL`, `#Grafana`
    *   **Multi-Device Synchronization**: Developed automation tools enabling real-time synchronous monitoring for **1-to-5** servers.
    *   **Visual Dashboard**: Integrated Grafana and MySQL to visualize and store sensor data in real-time, providing R&D personnel with intuitive performance analysis views.

4.  **Remote/Local server testing tool development**
    *   `#Golang`, `#Python`, `#Linux`, `#BashScript`
    *   **Hybrid Architecture Design**: Combined Golang's high concurrency with Python's rich ecosystem to build high-efficiency remote/local testing vehicles.
    *   **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensured tool compatibility and stability across different Linux distributions and hardware architectures.

#### GenAI and Corporate Productivity Enhancement

1.  **Automated code review tool using OpenAI API and Gitea Actions**
    *   `#AI`, `#LLM`, `#automatic`, `#workflow`, `#codereview`, `#restfulapi`, `#CI/CD`
    *   **DevOps Integration**: Built an automated review bot using Drone CI and Gitea Webhooks to trigger events and integrate the **OpenAI API**.
    *   **Workflow Optimization**: Successfully intercepted potential syntax errors and **reduced senior engineers' code review time by approximately 30%**, significantly enhancing team delivery efficiency.

2.  **GenAI-based email content extraction and automated delivery**
    *   `#AI`, `#LLM`, `#workflow`, `#CI`
    *   **Automated Workflow**: Utilized LLM technology to automatically analyze and extract key email content, achieving intelligent information distribution and delivery, reducing the time cost of manual filtering.
