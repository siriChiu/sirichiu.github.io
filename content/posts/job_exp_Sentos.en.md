### 💼 Project Achievements & Responsibilities

#### 1. Software Development & Process Automation
*   **WPF SDK Development**: Developed an Ultrasound Sensor Development Kit (SDK) using **C# (WPF)**. Transformed complex firmware parameter settings, which previously required manual config file entries, into an intuitive graphical interface.
*   **Smart Calibration Mechanism**: Designed an automated parameter adjustment process.
    *   *Solution*: Guided users to perform specific gestures (e.g., swiping left/right) on the sensor, and the program automatically analyzed the waveform to find the most suitable filter frequency.
    *   *Results*: Greatly simplified the tedious verification procedures required by differences in materials, hardware, and environments, significantly improving customer production line tuning efficiency and user experience.

#### 2. Algorithm & Firmware Engineering
*   **Signal Processing**: Conducted ultrasound signal analysis using **MATLAB**. Implemented noise filtering (including linear and non-linear filters) and developed touch algorithms to optimize gesture recognition accuracy.
*   **Firmware Implementation**: Wrote firmware using **C++**. Ported optimized performance parameters and new features (such as virtual button trigger mechanisms) into the firmware, successfully integrating them into products like smartphones (e.g., ROG Phone) and laptop touchpads.

#### 3. Global Collaboration & MP Support
*   **Technical Communication in English**: Participated in **weekly English technical synchronization meetings**, collaborating closely with the US headquarters engineering team to ensure technical specification alignment.
*   **Mass Production Crisis Management**: Served as a key technical contact during PVT (Product Verification Testing) and MP (Mass Production) stages. Quickly identified the root cause of anomalies reported by the production line and provided firmware fixes; established efficient analysis reports and escalation mechanisms for critical issues.
