## Abstract

The main purpose of this project is to use simple and inexpensive equipment like Raspberry Pi to implement remote real-time monitoring functions. Using Raspberry Pi as the main communication hub (Broker), NodeMCU as the IoT system's Client for first-line device operations, and MQTT transport protocol to handle [publish]/[subscribe] values between host and client, enabling the entire IoT system to operate smoothly.

## System Architecture

| Main Components | Function Description |
| --- | --- |
| Raspberry Pi 3 | The core of IoT, a powerful open-source single-board computer. Using Python supported by the system to establish MQTT connection protocol, completing [publish]/[subscribe] functions to Client side. |
| NodeMCU | An open-source IoT single-chip containing ESP8266 IoT WiFi chip. Small size yet powerful, using Arduino to develop programs establishing MQTT connection protocol, implementing [publish]/[subscribe] functions to Server side. |
| ESP8266 | A low-cost but feature-rich WiFi chip, also a core IoT component. Using ESP8266's AT commands to implement embedded system network connection transmission tools. |
| MQTT Protocol | A [publish]/[subscribe] type messaging protocol designed for low hardware performance and poor network conditions. Designed for IoT transmission, its [publish] and [subscribe] functions are the core of this project. |
